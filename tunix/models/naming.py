"""Model naming utilities.

This module provides utility functions to parse and handle model names and
convert them to internal model naming structures.

model_id:
The full model name identifier, as it appears on huggingface, including the
parent directory. E.g., meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B or Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B . This
model ID is case sensitive and should match exactly with HF. This is the path
that would be used to download the model from HF.

model_name:
The unique full name identifier of the model. This should be the full name and
should match exactly with the model name used in Hugging Face. e.g.,
"gemma-2b","llama-3.1-8b", "qwen2.5-0.5b". The model name is all lowercase and
typically formatted as <model-family>-<model-version>.

model_family:
The overall model family, e.g., "gemma", "gemma2", or "qwen2.5". Internally, we
use the standardized version of the model family, removing unnecessary '-',
e.g., "gemma-2" would be standardized to "gemma2", replacing '-' with '_',  and
replacing '.' with 'p',  e.g., "qwen2.5" would be standardized to "qwen2p5".

model_version:
The specific version of this model family. This would be the second portion of
the model name. It usually includes the size information, but also can have
other information, e.g., "it" representing instruction tuned. Internally, the
model version is standardized by lowercasing, replacing '-' with '_',  and
replacing '.' with 'p'. e.g., "2b-it" would be standardized to "2b_it".

model_config_category:
The model config category is the python class name of the ModelConfig class.
e.g.,both gemma and gemma2 models  have the category "gemma" with the
ModelConfig class being defined under gemma/model.py."

model_config_id:
The model config ID is the standardized version of the model family and model
version. It is used as the ID of the ModelConfig class. e.g., "gemma_2b_it" or
"qwen2p5_0p5b".
