  Attributes:
   algo_variant: The core algorithm variant to use.
   advantage_estimator: The advantage estimator to use.
   policy_loss_fn: The policy loss function to use.
   loss_agg_mode: The aggregation mode for the loss function.
   loss_algo: The loss algorithm to use. To be deprecated.
   num_generations: The number of times the policy generates multiple responses
     for a given prompt within a single training step. This corresponds to 'G'
     in Algorithm 1 in the paper. A higher value means more samples are used to
     compute relative advantages.
   num_iterations: The number of iterations per batch (𝜇 in GRPO algo 1).
   beta: The coefficient for the KL divergence penalty (𝛽) in the GRPO loss
     function. This term prevents policy updates from deviating too far from the
     reference model. A value of 0.0 means no KL penalty is applied. Always None
     for DAPO.
   epsilon: Epsilon value for clipping (𝜀 in GRPO loss in paper). Similar to
     PPO, it ensures stable updates.
   epsilon_high: Epsilon value for upper bound clipping.
   dynamic_sampling: Whether to use dynamic sampling.
   overlong_buffer: The overlong buffer to use for overlong reward shaping.
