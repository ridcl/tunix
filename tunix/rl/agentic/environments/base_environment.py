"""Base classes for reinforcement learning environments.

This module defines:

* `BaseEnv`: the minimal abstract base class that provides a standard
  interface for environments used in reinforcement learning tasks.

* `BaseTaskEnv`: a higher-level template environment that implements
  common episode management logic for task-based environments, including
  `max_steps` and step counting. Most single-turn and multi-turn task
  environments should subclass this instead of `BaseEnv` directly.
